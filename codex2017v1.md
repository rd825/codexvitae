# Rahul Desai's Codex Vitae
This document was inspired by [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). In his version, Benson laid out that his "document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe, track how my thoughts change over time, and act an invitation to others to hold me accountable to my beliefs and commitments." 

My version serves not only to accomplish those goals for myself but also to highlight the things I wish I knew earlier in life and record those things for the children I hope to one day have. Furthermore, this serves as a notebook to capture idea fragments that may benefit from public support, co-creation, or scrutiny.

## 1. Societal Mechanics:

### Religion

While I'm not religious, I do think that understanding religion is important. Religion's importance to me stems from the reason that it exists. As a species, humans are different from other creatures because of the fact that we alone seek causes for things. We seek to explain the world around us; to date, we have found no other life form that does so. As Maria Konnikova of [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-we-need-answers) notes:

>The human mind is incredibly averse to uncertainty and ambiguity; from an early age, we respond to uncertainty or lack of clarity by spontaneously generating plausible explanations... In 1972, the psychologist Jerome Kagan posited that uncertainty resolution was one of the foremost determinants of our behavior. When we can’t immediately gratify our desire to know, we become highly motivated to reach a concrete explanation... We want, in other words, to achieve “cognitive closure.” 

Religion offers human beings an explanatory system for the natural phenomena that they would not otherwise be able to explain. It is for this reason that we see flood stories from civilizations across the planet: the Biblical account of “Noah’s Ark”, the Greek myth of Deucalion, the Hindu story of Manu and the fish and the Babylonian tale of Utnapishtim from the Epic of Gilgamesh, to name a few. Flood stories exist because of the nature of floods themselves. Ancient civilizations tended to center on rivers and could not expand too far  beyond them due to the limits of irrigation technology; thus, the bounds of the "known world" were constrained. When the rivers flooded, it seemed like they would flood the whole world. Of course, while floods can bring life (as in Egypt), they can also be wildly destructive. Ancient peoples sought an explanation for this destruction.

[Dr. Tania Lombrozo](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/why-we-wonder-why/) from Berkeley says that "people prefer explanations that provide a function or purpose, called 'teleological explanations.' If I ask, for instance, 'why does your cup have a handle?' a teleological explanations might be, 'The cup has a handle so that you can lift it without burning your fingers.'" Floods, teleologically explained, happen to smite people's wickedness and cause rebirth per various religions. 

This brings me to my main point: religion is important to understand because people use it to describe the world. While you or I might not subscribe to those belief systems, understanding others' religions gives us a view into understanding them. My favorite theory of how one might reconcile various religions is recounted [here](https://beyondtherobot.com/could-all-religions-be-true-919b713852ae) by Jack Preston King.

Simply put:
>All of Humanity is climbing the same Holy Mountain. It’s a big enough mountain that the landscape and the weather are different depending on which side you’re climbing. It’s so wide at the base that you have to have ascended quite a distance to even become aware you’re on a mountain with more than one side, that you’re climbing something other than a flat, vertical plane. At the top of the mountain is a Great Truth that is calling us all toward it.

The maps up the mountain are religions. They appear shockingly different due to the conditions different spiritual cartographers face. Different histories, cultures, and other factors all lead to different maps. Most importantly, though, is that each mapmaker's truth is true from the perspective of the map and path they're following. 

>While we’re on one side or another of the mountain, we’re stuck with a limited view, and we squabble over particulars. At the summit, that just won’t happen, for reasons that will make perfect sense when we get there, but not a moment before. It [The Holy Mount metaphor] suggests that perceived contradictions are only apparent, the result of drawing short-sighted conclusions before we’ve gathered all the relevant evidence. When the day comes that we do, in fact, “know it all” (instead of merely pretending to), we’ll all agree on everything.

### Money

A friend of mine recently (as of Apr. 2017) asked me why I want what many people consider an egregious amount of money (i.e. 8 figures in net worth). I didn't get around to answering her that particular day, but I would like to be clear about what the point of money is for me. 

Money is __*not*__ meant to be acquired as an end in itself. Money must be viewed as a resource, rather than a goal; one would be wise to keep that top of mind. If we try to acquire money just for the sake of a number on a bank account statement or pay stub, we subject ourselves to running on the [hedonic treadmill](http://coglode.com/gems/hedonic-adaptation). Simply put, this means that as we become accustomed to bigger numbers, we adapt to them and need more and more to get the same positive feelings. Thus, money becomes our drug. 

In that case, what is the point of acquiring money? Why bother at all? To paraphrase the late Gianni Versace, "money buys freedom." For me, freedom falls into two buckets: (a) freedom from worry and (b) freedom from involuntary decision-making. Of course, those two might be sides of the same coin, but in any case, those two types of freedom are what I aspire to currently. 

When I say freedom from worry, I mean that anxiety about affording my kids' college or my monthly bills or any number of other daily minutiae fades away. With enough money, the tedious concerns of daily life cease to exist; of course, money brings with it worry of its own (e.g. worry about losing your money or worry about the performance of your investments), but I currently find investing a scintillating activity and try to do so according to my appetite for risk. By limiting the amount I can lose, I limit the amount of worry I can experience.

When I talk about freedom from involuntary decision-making, I'm referring to not having my hand forced due to lack of money. This means not feeling forced to take loans with draconian terms or making decisions that weaken my position in order to shore up my financial position short-term. When people feel desperate, they tend to make bad choices and lose sight of the long game. However, if Warren Buffett can teach us anything, it's that patience and long-termism are powerful tools. 

Tied to this is the idea of BATNA, which is the "best alternative to negotiated agreement." In simple terms, your BATNA is your next best option if whatever deal you're making falls through. With enough cash to both be content and free from worry, your BATNA is to simply walk away; as the [principle of least interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_interest) says that the person who is least interested (i.e. can walk away) has the most power in any form of relationship.
