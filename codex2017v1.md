# Codex Vitae
This document was inspired by [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). In his version, Benson laid out that his "document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe, track how my thoughts change over time, and act an invitation to others to hold me accountable to my beliefs and commitments." 

My version serves not only to accomplish those goals for myself but also to highlight the things I wish I knew earlier in life and record those things for the children I hope to one day have. Furthermore, this serves as a notebook to capture idea fragments that may benefit from public support, co-creation, or scrutiny.
