# Rahul Desai's Codex Vitae
This document was inspired by [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2016.md). In his version, Benson laid out that his "document's purpose is to capture [his] beliefs about the universe, track how [his] thoughts change over time, and act an invitation to others to hold [him] accountable to [his] beliefs and commitments." 

My version serves not only to accomplish those goals for myself but also to highlight the things I wish I knew earlier in life and record those things for the children I hope to one day have. Furthermore, this serves as a notebook to capture idea fragments that may benefit from public support, co-creation, or scrutiny.

### Religion

While I'm not religious, I do think that understanding religion is important. Religion's importance to me stems from the reason that it exists. As a species, humans are different from other creatures because of the fact that we alone seek causes for things. We seek to explain the world around us; to date, we have found no other life form that does so. As Maria Konnikova of [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-we-need-answers) notes:

>The human mind is incredibly averse to uncertainty and ambiguity; from an early age, we respond to uncertainty or lack of clarity by spontaneously generating plausible explanations... In 1972, the psychologist Jerome Kagan posited that uncertainty resolution was one of the foremost determinants of our behavior. When we can’t immediately gratify our desire to know, we become highly motivated to reach a concrete explanation... We want, in other words, to achieve “cognitive closure.” 

Religion offers human beings an explanatory system for the natural phenomena that they would not otherwise be able to explain. It is for this reason that we see flood stories from civilizations across the planet: the Biblical account of “Noah’s Ark”, the Greek myth of Deucalion, the Hindu story of Manu and the fish and the Babylonian tale of Utnapishtim from the Epic of Gilgamesh, to name a few. Flood stories exist because of the nature of floods themselves. Ancient civilizations tended to center on rivers and could not expand too far  beyond them due to the limits of irrigation technology; thus, the bounds of the "known world" were constrained. When the rivers flooded, it seemed like they would flood the whole world. Of course, while floods can bring life (as in Egypt), they can also be wildly destructive. Ancient peoples sought an explanation for this destruction.

[Dr. Tania Lombrozo](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/why-we-wonder-why/) from Berkeley says that "people prefer explanations that provide a function or purpose, called 'teleological explanations.' If I ask, for instance, 'why does your cup have a handle?' a teleological explanations might be, 'The cup has a handle so that you can lift it without burning your fingers.'" Floods, teleologically explained, happen to smite people's wickedness and cause rebirth per various religions. 

This brings me to my main point: religion is important to understand because people use it to describe the world. While you or I might not subscribe to those belief systems, understanding others' religions gives us a view into understanding them. My favorite theory of how one might reconcile various religions is recounted [here](https://beyondtherobot.com/could-all-religions-be-true-919b713852ae) by Jack Preston King.

Simply put:
>All of Humanity is climbing the same Holy Mountain. It’s a big enough mountain that the landscape and the weather are different depending on which side you’re climbing. It’s so wide at the base that you have to have ascended quite a distance to even become aware you’re on a mountain with more than one side, that you’re climbing something other than a flat, vertical plane. At the top of the mountain is a Great Truth that is calling us all toward it.

The maps up the mountain are religions. They appear shockingly different due to the conditions different spiritual cartographers face. Different histories, cultures, and other factors all lead to different maps. Most importantly, though, is that each mapmaker's truth is true from the perspective of the map and path they're following. 

>While we’re on one side or another of the mountain, we’re stuck with a limited view, and we squabble over particulars. At the summit, that just won’t happen, for reasons that will make perfect sense when we get there, but not a moment before. It [The Holy Mount metaphor] suggests that perceived contradictions are only apparent, the result of drawing short-sighted conclusions before we’ve gathered all the relevant evidence. When the day comes that we do, in fact, “know it all” (instead of merely pretending to), we’ll all agree on everything.

### Money

A friend of mine recently (as of Apr. 2017) asked me why I want what many people consider an egregious amount of money (i.e. 8 figures in net worth). I didn't get around to answering her that particular day, but I would like to be clear about what the point of money is for me. 

Money is __*not*__ meant to be acquired as an end in itself. Money must be viewed as a resource, rather than a goal; one would be wise to keep that top of mind. If we try to acquire money just for the sake of a number on a bank account statement or pay stub, we subject ourselves to running on the [hedonic treadmill](http://coglode.com/gems/hedonic-adaptation). Simply put, this means that as we become accustomed to bigger numbers, we adapt to them and need more and more to get the same positive feelings. Thus, money becomes our drug. 

In that case, what is the point of acquiring money? Why bother at all? To paraphrase the late Gianni Versace, "money buys freedom." For me, freedom falls into two buckets: (a) freedom from worry and (b) freedom from involuntary decision-making. Of course, those two might be sides of the same coin, but in any case, those two types of freedom are what I aspire to currently. 

When I say freedom from worry, I mean that anxiety about affording my kids' college or my monthly bills or any number of other daily minutiae fades away. With enough money, the tedious concerns of daily life cease to exist; of course, money brings with it worry of its own (e.g. worry about losing your money or worry about the performance of your investments), but I currently find investing a scintillating activity and try to do so according to my appetite for risk. By limiting the amount I can lose, I limit the amount of worry I can experience.

When I talk about freedom from involuntary decision-making, I'm referring to not having my hand forced due to lack of money. This means not feeling forced to take loans with draconian terms or making decisions that weaken my position in order to shore up my financial position short-term. When people feel desperate, they tend to make bad choices and lose sight of the long game. However, if Warren Buffett can teach us anything, it's that patience and long-termism are powerful tools. 

Tied to this is the idea of BATNA, which is the "best alternative to negotiated agreement." In simple terms, your BATNA is your next best option if whatever deal you're making falls through. With enough cash to both be content and free from worry, your BATNA is to simply walk away; as the [principle of least interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_interest) says that the person who is least interested (i.e. can walk away) has the most power in any form of relationship.

### Business Thinking

Here's a hit list of things I believe about business management. More simply, this is about how to make profit by building things people want and managing talent well, among other topics.

#### Benevolent Dictatorship

1) The majority of the population cannot really articulate what it is they want. People's thinking and expectations are constrained by the past; you must show them a better future.

2) This requires a single, overarching vision. Note that word choice: "vision," not "idea." Ideas are a dime a dozen. Anyone can have a "good idea." But vision comes from deep understanding of a problem. You don't have to be an expert. You just need to get really smart about a big problem in the world and find a novel, efficient, _better_ way to solve it.

3) In order to prevent dilution of vision, you need a benevolent dictator in charge. When decisions are made by committee or consensus, debates slow down forward progress and the vision that drives things forward is diluted by too many voices. Almost every successful startup ($1B+ exit) is therefore a [cult of personality](https://www.thoughtdistiller.com/polarizing-personality/). 

4) Notably, this vein of management thinking should only be enacted if there is a hierarchy of power and influence. Among equal partners (e.g. law, investing, marriage), decisions should be made by consensus. If the partners lack (a) trust in each other and (b) conviction in their joint decisions, the partnership will likely fail longterm.

5) Thus, a benevolent dictator sets vision, has veto power, and makes final decisions. However, this person must welcome team contributions and cooperation; otherwise, they will find themselves without teammates quite quickly. The dictator tells people what to do, never how to do it. To quote [Shyam Sankar](http://shyamsankar.com/position-and-portfolio) of Palantir, "Despite the necessity of joint ownership (or perhaps because of it), some things simply require a dictator to get done. This is especially true in product development, where not only does halving the team often double the pace of progress, but the fulfillment of a coherent vision usually requires one actual visionary."

6) When deciding, it helps the team dynamic to allow people to indicate their viewpoint. If a minority of people disagree with the dictator, they should just disagree and commit with the dictator. If a majority disagree, the dictator should disagree and commit with the majority. Therefore, complete consensus isn’t required to move forward, just the team’s sense that the vision is maintained.

7) The goal of the benevolent dictator is to protect the product vision, not his or her own ego. This means that a good leader will tell people what needs to be done when it needs to be done, but be flexible enough to listen and adapt to the concerns of their teammates. Ultimately, the best product leaders will use their influence and vision to act as force multipliers for their teams.

#### Radical Transparency

see Hubspot.

#### Labor-Hours

Time tracking doesn't matter. Idc how long you work, so long as you hit goals and ship quality product by deadlines or better. If you can do your job in 30 minutes, awesome. You get a promotion.

#### Remote Work / Vacation

unlimited given certain parameters that I haven't thought of yet.

#### Data-Driven

no decisions should be made due to emotion or opinion alone. Data rules everything around me. revisit "brilliant assholes"

## 2. "Confessions"

### Intro

In Victorian England, one pastime among friends and family was to jot down your “Confessions”— answers to semi-serious questions of taste and principle. I have taken the list of [questions](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/04/01.htm) that Karl Marx answered in the spring of 1865, and have provided my own answers. While Marx did not indicate why he answered questions in any particular way, I have strived to provide some explanation of my choices. These are my confessions.

"Normalcy is not an objective state, waiting to be discovered. It is a social construction of society... This ability to normalize just about anything is simultaneously one of our species’ greatest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses... Giving positions of power to people based on favoritism, or nepotism, or on how easily they can be controlled from above is a dangerous norm for our democracy... Consider that your very presence in such a system provides consent. Consent is the fuel any Administration needs to continue to normalize what it is doing." <br>
-**Noah Kunin**, former Infrastructure Director @ 18F ([source](https://medium.com/@noahkunin/why-im-leaving-18f-48970131d547)) <br>

### Unsolicited Advice

Anger, frustration, and other negative emotions have an optimal window in which they actually help you get shit done. Too little and you're not motivated; too much and you're paralyzed. When you find yourself in the sweet spot, exert your negative energy to get results (see [sublimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(psychology))).

Experience only matters insofar as you have the basic skills to get the job done. The ability to learn quickly is far more important and helps you level up faster (Hunter Walk describes this as "[betting on people prematurely](https://hunterwalk.com/2014/04/11/bet-on-people-prematurely/)"). 

If you want to figure out what a person or group of people truly values, compare what they say to what they do. People tend to say lots of things, many of which they don't actually mean. Therefore, examining their actions is the only way to parse out their motives, beliefs, and values (see [revealed preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference)).

Nobody knows what they're doing. And as you get older, you become more aware of just how little you know. That's ok: you don't need to know everything about everything. You just need to know a lot about a little and a little about a lot.

When you decide what you want to do, don't optimize for "what you love," which is the garbage advice most people will give you. Optimize for three things: (a) something that fascinates you, (b) something that will change the world in the future (right now, May 2017, that's bioengineering, blockchain, and AI/ML), and (c) something you're good at. If you can do those things, you'll get satisfaction from being curious, making advances in your field, and accruing personal acheievement. 

Not everything in life is winner-take-all or zero-sum, but it's best to go after it like it is. You have to compete at a high enough level to take advantage of the best opportunities. Compete so hard that you're not just in a different league, but playing a different game. Only that leads you to have monopoly power.

### Anecdotes

When I was 15, I wanted a job at McDonald's. My dad said to me, “If you want a job so bad , I will pay you $6 an hour. I will pay you $6 an hour every hour you stand looking at the wall.” I asked him “For real?” Then, being young, I asked “Is there a limit to how many hours I can stand?” “No,” he said, “every day, all day.” My younger brother was jealous and said, “What about me?” My dad said, “You too!” So we both faced the wall in the dining room and he only had 2 rules: we must pay attention to the wall and not lean on it. My younger 12-year-old brother lasted less than a half hour and I lasted 2 and half hours; standing was okay, but focusing on the wall was near torture. Having no goals, being homeless, not trying to exceed your own abilities in any way is simply choosing a way of life that leads to the wall, which then leads to drugs and alcohol to cope.
